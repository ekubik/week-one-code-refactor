# 01 HTML, CSS, and Git: Code Refactor

The project involved refactoring the supplied code so that it adhered to the following user story and acceptance criteria:

## User Story

```
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```

Once the acceptance criteria were met, the site was to appear as in the demo image provided. Changes were made to enhance and improve the code structure without altering the appearance of the website.
